## CLIMATE COMPANION
The Climate Companion project aims to enhance road safety and travel efficiency by integrating real-time weather data with navigation systems. It allows users to plan routes that avoid adverse weather conditions, like rain, thunderstorms, and snow, ensuring safer journeys. By offering dynamic rerouting based on changing weather patterns, it not only improves driving comfort but also helps drivers reach their destinations with minimal disruptions.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The Climate Companion project is an innovative navigation system that integrates real-time weather data to enhance driving safety and optimize travel routes. By analyzing weather conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed, it dynamically adjusts routes to help drivers avoid adverse weather. The system features an intuitive user interface, allowing users to input destinations and receive updated route suggestions based on changing weather patterns. Utilizing a combination of advanced APIs for weather and mapping, it ensures seamless integration and real-time notifications for users. Ultimately, the project aims to improve road safety, enhance user experience, and promote efficient travel.


## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
The Climate Companion project offers several features aimed at optimizing travel by integrating weather data with navigation systems. Hereâ€™s a list of its core features:

1. Weather-Integrated Route Planning:
Provides real-time weather information and incorporates it into the navigation system, suggesting the safest and most efficient route based on current weather conditions.
2. Dynamic Route Updates:
Continuously monitors weather changes during a trip and adjusts the route in real-time, ensuring drivers avoid hazardous conditions like storms, heavy rain, or snow.
3. Weather Alerts:
Sends notifications and alerts about sudden or severe weather changes, like thunderstorms, floods, or extreme temperatures, that could affect the journey.
4. User-Specific Route Suggestions:
Allows users to set preferences based on their starting point, destination, and preferred weather conditions, offering personalized travel suggestions.
5. Map Integration:
Integrates seamlessly with Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, displaying both the route and live weather overlays on the map.
6. Safe Route Visualization:
Highlights safe routes on the map using color codes or visual indicators that reflect weather severity, making it easy to distinguish between safe and risky paths.
